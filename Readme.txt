The current driver that I'm using is for MacOS. If you are using Window, please clone code, download the suitable version of chrome driver and copy to src/main/resources/drivers. After that, go to src/main/java/utils/SeleniumUtils.java and refactor driver name (which is suitable for your platform).

You can find feature files in src/test/resources/com/features

Runner file is stored in src/test/java/com

Enjoy the test :)
